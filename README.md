# SHO Simulation of a Disneyland Park

This project was created as part of a university assignment focused on the **entertainment industry**. The goal was to build a **SHO (System-Human-Organization)** model that simulates how visitors and the system behave in an amusement park, focusing on **economic analysis**.

## Project Goal

The project simulates one of the parks in Disneyland Paris â€” **Walt Disney Studios Park**, which includes:
- **10 attractions**
- **4 thematic sections**

The simulation models:
- Visitor entry
- Attraction selection
- Queue waiting
- Ride experience

The primary goal was to compare the **total revenue** generated by two pricing models:
1. **Single-entry ticket** (current approach)
2. **Pay-per-attraction** pricing model

The experiment demonstrates that charging per attraction, rather than a one-time entrance fee, can potentially **increase the park's total revenue**.


## Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++
- **Simulation Library:** SIMLIB


## Running the Simulation

To compile the project:
```bash
make
```

You can simulate different seasons with:
```bash
./model summer [+/-number]
./model winter [+/-number]
./model spring [+/-number]
./model autumn [+/-number]
```

Optional `+/-number` adjusts the base price of all attractions:

- `+number` increases the price

- `-number` decreases the price

Default prices are set to match the "Premier Access" model from Disneyland Paris. This allows testing of various pricing strategies.
